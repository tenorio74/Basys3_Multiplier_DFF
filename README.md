# Basys3_Multiplier_DFF

The purpose of this project is for my Electrical Engineering 535: VLSI Design Course.  We are creating a 4 x 4 bit multiplier with the product being the input to a register consisting of D Flip Flops.  Our task is to develop this using our own EDA Tools and methods.  The tools we are using are DSCH, Microwind and Xilinx.  This is the part of the project which impliments my logic on an FPGA Board.  The board we are using is the Basys 3: Artix 7 board from Digilent.  Documentation for the Basys 3 can be found here: https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/programmable-logic/basys-3/start.  The HDL language used is verilog and I've demonstrated two methods for module instantiation.  On the Basys 3 the inputs are switches sw[7:0] or the first 8 switches.  Input A is sw[7:4] and input B is sw[3:0].  The output will be displayed on the seven segment display which has been included on this part of the project for verification purposes but will not be on the final design.
